# MFWS_RapidFloristics_2021

•	The extended sanctuary fence area of the MFWS will soon be free of foxes and Ngaluda (eastern bettong Bettongia gaimardi) will be translocated.
•	In early-October 2021, anecdotal observations that orchids and other geophytes where very abundant in Gorrooyarroo compared to the established Sanctuary where they appeared rare were made by multiple people. 
•	This highlighted that:
o	(1) there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the overall effect of MFWS Ngaluda (a herbivore population that is not top-down regulated by any predation) on woodland floristic value (where they have both positive effects [e.g. diggings facilitate native species recruitment] and negative effects [e.g. diggings promote weed establishment]) (Ross et al. 2020), and
o	(2) specifically understanding the effect of Ngaluda on orchids and other geophytes (that are food resources for Ngaluda) was particularly important as these are threatened values of a critically endangered vegetation community.
•	However, there was no easy way to resolve this uncertainty because:
o	(1) no systematic monitoring of the MFWS floristic community has occurred since the reintroduction of Ngaluda (floristics last monitored in 2011 as part of the MFGOWE (McIntyre et al. 2014)),
o	(2) the infrastructure that was established to provide a “Ngaluda present v Ngaluda absent” comparison within the Mulligan’s Sanctuary area was unfortunately not successful in excluding Ngaluda (Evans et al. 2019), and
o	(3) No one had the time (no available experienced botanists) or resources (no funding available to pay experienced botanists) to repeat the systematic floristic monitoring of the MFGOWE in-full in the 2021 spring season.
•	By mid-October 2021, we decided it was worth collecting spatially-extensive and comparable information on some key floristic values from across MFWS to establish some contemporary information on which to contextualise decisions and not miss the opportunity of the 2021 spring season.
•	Our design does not explicitly test the effect of Ngaluda, but rather allows for comparison between the Mulligans Sanctuary area of the MFWS (where Ngaluda are present) and the other areas of the MFWS where Ngaluda are absent. 
•	While the presence and absence of Ngaluda is not the only way the areas of MFWS differ (e.g. McIntyre et al. 2010; Manning et al. 2020), our design and analysis considers other explanatory factors like in plant community type, condition state, ground cover vegetation, biomass and dominate grass type that also differ among the areas. 

Methods
Question :: Does the occurrence and relative abundance of tuberous lilies, orchids, and daisies differ among the different areas of the MFWS?
Number of plots (observation unit) = 112
-	Most plots (n=88) were associated with ACT Government Herbage Mass Monitoring to take advantage of vegetation structure and ground cover data that was being collected.
-	The other plots (n=24) were those of the “bettong fences” sites of the MFGOWE
-	All plots were grouped in pairs with plots at least 100m apart (the “Polygon” or “Site” in the Herbage Mass and MFGOWE respectively)
-	Replication among the Areas of the MFWS is as follows:
Mulligans (inside fence)    = 46 (24 in bettong fences, 22 out of bettong fences) 
Goorooyarroo		   = 30
Mulligans (outside fence) = 6
Offsets			   = 30

Floristic plots were 400m2 circular quadrats consistent with floristic monitoring being undertaken on the Offsets areas of the MFWS since 2017 (ACT Government 2020).

In each quadrat the combined population count of 5 ‘indicator groups’ was recorded as either 0 (absent), <10 (1-9 individuals), 10-<100, 100-<1000, 1000+ (so are there singles, tens, hundreds, or thousands). The indicator groups targeted were:
Lilies:   Arthropodium spp., Bulbine spp., Wurmbea dioica, Burchardia umbellate
Orchids: all orchid species
Daisies (tuberous): Microseris spp., Craspedia spp.
Daisies control (no tuber or starchy tap root): Leptorhynchos squamatus, Chrysocephalum apiculatum
Other control: Stackhousia monogyna

This method allowed rapid assessments to be undertaken through limiting the species that needed to be searched for and accurately identified. All species contributing to an indicator group were recorded, however only the most abundant was accurately counted on the relative abundance scale.  

Monitoring was undertaken by 1 or 2 people on foot or mountain bike from 26-Oct to 16-Nov at a rate of 7.63 plots per person day (full program field work therefore requiring 15 person days to complete). 

Explanatory variables 1: MAPPED QUALITIES (Factors)
5 factorial explanatory variables were attached to our observations that could explain some of the variance in our response variables. They were:

Explanatory variables 2: OBSERVERED VEGETATION STRUCTURE VARIABLES (numerical data)
13 numerical explanatory variables recorded in the field were attached to our observations that could explain some of the variance in our response variables. They were:
•	PROPORTIONAL cover (range = 0-1) of Canopy, Understorey, Native Grass, Native Shrub, Native Other, Rock, Bare Ground, Litter, Thatch, Exotic Broadleaf, Exotic Grass
•	% Nativeness of perennial vegetated ground layer 
•	Average grass height (cm)

Data Analysis – see R code for full details
Generalised linear mixed models for each univariate response variable. Random effect of “Polygon” included to account for any spatial autocorrelation associated with the paired arrangement of plots
Model selection of the full model (y ~ additive effects of all explanatory variables) using AICc to identify the “best” candidate model for each response variable (best combination of fixed-effects that explain the highest amount of variation in the response variable).
