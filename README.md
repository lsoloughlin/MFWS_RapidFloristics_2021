# MFWS_RapidFloristics_2021

Start with "TubeMFWS_SummaryFigures.R" which imports "TuberousPlants_MFWS_Data.xslx" to plot the raw data as spatial maps (lat/long location of points coloured by area and sized by response variable. The data file also includes a metadata tab that explains each variable in the dataframe. Any questions on methodology etc. please get in contact.

Second is "TubeMFWS_2_FirstDataAnalysis" which imports "MFWS-RapidFloristicData-2021.csv" (same observations as previous data file but with additional mapped explanatory variables joined), "MFWS-VegStructData-2021.csv" (the matched vegetation structure monitoring that occurred at most (88/112) plots), and "MULLonly-RapidFloristicData-2021.csv" (same observations as previous data file but only > Area == "MULL" observations and a few new columns that represent the experimental treatments within MULL in a few different ways
